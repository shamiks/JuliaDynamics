# JuliaDynamics
This repository stores some basic numerical solutions of dynamic problems, implemented in Julia code, using publicly available libraries like Gridap etc.

Examples include: 

  [Linear Elastic] (https://github.com/shamiks/JuliaDynamics/blob/main/JuliaDynamicsExamples/LinearElastic/LinElasticity.ipynb)
