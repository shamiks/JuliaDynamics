# JuliaDynamics
This repository stores some **Julia notebooks** with basic numerical solutions of various **dynamic** problems. Simulations are mostly done using publicly available libraries like **Gridap** etc.

Examples include: 

  [Linear Elastic] (https://github.com/shamiks/JuliaDynamics/blob/main/JuliaDynamicsExamples/LinearElastic/LinElasticity.ipynb)
